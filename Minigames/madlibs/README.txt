To add a madlib template in two steps:

- 1. Create a new timeline in the Dialogic panel. Look to madlib1.dtl for inspiration.
- 2. Edit madlib_controller.gd to add your timeline name to the list.

That's literally everything. Your timeline will be picked up by the system and added to the rotation.
